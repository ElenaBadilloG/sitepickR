Like generalizeR, package designed selecting schools can used select type site defined geography administrative responsibility (e.g., county, job training center, health clinic). Unlike generalizeR, sitepicker designed select sites two stages —first “units” contain multiple sites located nearby /administration “subunits” containing individual sites. Two-stage sampling may necessary cost study depend number units (e.g., school districts), one-stage sample subunits (e.g., schools) likely contain units study can afford. main function package, selectMatch() lets user carry two-level sample selection possibility initially selected participant wanting participate anticipated. procedure aims reduce bias (/loss generalizability population) introduce. selecting units subunits, sitepickR uses cube method (e.g., Deville & Tillé, 2004; Tillé 2011). cube method probability sampling method designed satisfy criteria balance sample population. Recent research shown method performs well simulations studies educational programs (Fay & Olsen, review). implement cube method, sitepickerR uses sampling R package. Users option select units equal probabilities probabilities proportional “size” measured terms number subunits nested within units. addition, sitepickR uses statistical matching select possible replacement units. education RCTs, share selected districts agrees participate tends low. address challenge, sitepickR selects ranks 10 replacement districts districts selected using cube method. Replacement districts selected using statistical matching based propensity score methods. implement statistical matching, sitepickR uses MatchIt R package. sitepickR’s core sampling + matching procedure, implemented selectMatch() function, consists four main steps: Study sample design: identify: 1) target population nested structure (e.g. [school district:school]); 2) observable covariates interest unit level; 3) observable covariates interest sub-unit level. Randomly select initial sample units target population. Obtain list ‘best’ matches (e.g. replacement candidates) initially selected unit, terms covariates interest. Balance initially selected (‘original’) units target population. Balance original units group matches (1 K, closest ). Balance sub-units associated unit replacement group original sub-units population, terms available covariates interest, unit sub-unit level. vignette guide reader, step--step, sitepickR’s basic functionalities, data Common Core Data (CCD) California schools (2017-18), using pre-processed dataset comes package installation. technical details package’s main functions sample dataset included documentation.","code":""},{"path":"/articles/sitepickR-demo.html","id":"package-and-data-set-up","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Package and data set up","title":"sitePickR: Getting Started","text":"First, needed, install sitepickR package help devtools: Now load package calling library: Now let’s load sample CCD-California 2017-18 dataset comes installed package: Process raw aggregate dataset order format expected selectMatch using sitepckr makeDF() function. re-define key variables create new variable, ‘unitSize’, used step selectMatch procedure units initially sampled.
